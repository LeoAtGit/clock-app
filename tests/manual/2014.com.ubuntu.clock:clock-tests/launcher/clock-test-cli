    Applications) and its interaction with the system. The test suites are
    split into various groups based on their functionality like alarm, 
    settings etc.

    a 'passed' result.
    
    If an action fails, or produces an unexpected results, please submit a
    'failed' result and file a bug. Please be sure to include the bug number
    when you submit your result.
