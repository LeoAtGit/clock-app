Code Style
==========

We are trying to use a common code style throughout the code base to maintain
uniformity and improve code clarity. Listed below are the code styles guides
that will be followed based on the language used.

QML        - http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qml-codingconventions.html 
C++        - https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml
Python     - Code should follow PEP8 and Flake regulations
